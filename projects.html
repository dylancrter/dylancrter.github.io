        Thus far into my Computer Science career, I have worked on a variety of projects. The majority of which have been for school in my Intro to Programming, Software Development, and Data Structures classes. With this foundational 
        knowledge, I have also expanded to other projects outside of school that utilize other languages and frameworks. I enjoy looking back on them but also know that there is so much more I want and need to do right now. I have 
        included some of my most relevant projects below:
