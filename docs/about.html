        Thank you so much for visiting my about me page! My name is Dylan Carter and I am from Atlanta, GA. I currently live in Athens, GA as I am working towards my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Georgia.

        Some of my interests include sports (mainly baseball and football), programming (obviously), math, AI, investing, and rock music (especially if it's jazz-infused). I like to follow companies at the forefront of AI such as 
        Nvidia, Tesla, Google, Meta, Hugging Face, and OpenAI to keep up with industry trends. I also enjoy managing my investment portfolio (currently only consists of Google, Tesla, BTC, and VUG). In the future, my main goal is 
        to acquire exceptional skills and create AI that will help serve humanity in some way. I am not sure what that will look like yet, but I am excited to find out!
