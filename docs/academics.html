        As I'm sure you can tell by now, I currently attend the University of Georgia as a Computer Science major. I am currently in my second year of study and am on track to graduate in May 2025. I am planning on persuing a Master's Degree
        in Artificial Intelligence to expand my knowledge of machine learning and programming. It will also give me more time to expand my project portfolio and work experience before landing a full-time job, not to mention I love being bulldog!
        The relevant courses I've currently taken are listed below:
    </p>
    <p>
        MATH 2250: Calculus Principles <br />
        MATH 2260: Integral Calculus <br />
        MATH 2270: Multivariable Calculus <br />
        CSCI 1301: Intro to Programming <br />
        CSCI 1302: Software Development <br />
        CSCI 1730: Systems Programming <br />
        CSCI 2150: Computational Science <br />
        CSCI 2610: Discrete Math <br />
        CSCI 2670: Theory of Computing <br />
        CSCI 2720: Data Structures <br />
        CSCI 3030: Computing Ethics <br /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        These courses have given me a solid foundation in computer science and have allowed me to explore different areas of the field. After this next semester, I will have completed all of my core classes and will be able to take strictly 
        computer science classes (finally!). I am excited for these, but in the meantime I am also doing self-learning using mainly Youtube, Leetcode, and Coursera to strengthen my programming and math knowledge. I also took a Machine Learning
        course by Andrew Ng through Stanford and Deeplearning.AI to gain a novice level understanding of machine learning, which is what has gauged my interest in AI. The link for my certificate is found below:

        I have a strong belief in education and its power to change the way people view and interact with the world. I love the University of Georgia and I'm very thankful I get to be a part of its community. Go Dawgs!
