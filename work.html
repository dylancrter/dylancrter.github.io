        My work experience thus far although not related to computer science, I believe has helped instill principles in me that will help me in my future goal of helping people with AI. My time in each position taught me the importance of 
        hard work, communication among a team, and the ability to adapt to new situations. I have also learned the importance of being able to work with people from all walks of life and how to be a leader in a team.
